# SkyGlyphs Satellite Letters 🌍✨

A community-driven collection of **real satellite images** that resemble letters of the alphabet.  
Most of the images come from **NASA's Landsat program**, while others are contributed by the community.  
Together, they form Earth's natural alphabet — no AI, just authentic satellite photography.

## 🚀 How It's Used
These images are used in the [SkyGlyphs Frontend](https://github.com/ReddyKousic/skyGlyphsFrntnd)  
to generate words and names from satellite photos.

## 🤝 Contributing
We welcome contributions from the community!  
If you have authentic satellite images that look like letters:

1. Add your `.webp` image to the repo.
2. Name it using the convention:  
   `<letter>-<place>-<country>.webp`
3. Update `manifest.json` with your new image.
4. Open a **Pull Request**.

⚠️ Please ensure images are from **publicly available satellite data** (e.g., NASA Landsat, ESA Sentinel, USGS EarthExplorer) and **not AI generated**.
